# NCF - NeuCharFramework

<img src="./images/logo.png" width="300" />

NeuCharFramework (hereinafter referred to as NCF) is a comprehensive framework for building foundational projects, including basic caching, database, models, validation, and supporting management backend. It is modular and highly extensible.

> NCF is derived from SenparcCore, an internal system framework optimized and iterated over many years by the Senparc team. It has been tested in numerous systems under .NET 3.5/4.5 and has finally been ported to .NET Core (also supporting .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0). NCF is highly modular. It is currently running stably in multiple .NET Core systems. During its transformation into an open-source project, a series of refactoring, annotation improvements, and compatibility upgrades are needed. It is still in its infancy, and we hope to receive more feedback. We will strive to optimize and release the first official version as soon as possible. Thank you for your continuous support, and welcome to join the community of contributors!

> In the Preview1 version, we will provide a more complete modular architecture and auxiliary tools. The current source code is already available for learning and testing purposes.
