> NCF is derived from SenparcCore, the underlying framework of the self-use system optimized and iterated by the Senparc team over the years. It has undergone practical tests in numerous systems of .NET Framework 3.5/4.5 and was eventually ported to .NET Core (also supporting .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0/8.0), highly modular. NCF is currently running stably in many large and medium-sized applications. Thank you for your continuous support, and we welcome your suggestions and feedback, or join the ranks of community contributors!
