> NCF is derived from the SenparcCore, an internal system framework optimized and iterated by the Senparc team over many years. It has been tested in numerous systems on .NET Framework 3.5/4.5 and has finally been ported to .NET Core (also supporting .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0/8.0). It is highly modular. NCF is currently running stably in many large and medium-sized applications. Thank you all for your continuous support. We welcome your feedback and suggestions, or join the ranks of community contributors!
