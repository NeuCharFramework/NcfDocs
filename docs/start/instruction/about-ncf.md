NeuCharFramework(NCF) is a comprehensive framework for building foundational projects, including basic caching, database, models, validation, and supporting management backend. It is modular, highly extensible, and durable.

## Philosophy: Simple, Flexible, Extensible

### Simple

Provide a robust and durable underlying framework, not pursuing perfection, but must be practical.

### Flexible

Stricter DDD model design, combined with modular applications to flexibly respond to changes.

### Extensible

Provide a highly modular architecture, one-click installation, one-second integration.

## Supported .NET Versions

NCF is fully compatible with .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0/8.0/9.0.

## Supported Databases

Currently supports SQLite, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Dameng (Dm), and other databases.

## Description

> NCF is derived from SenparcCore, an underlying system framework optimized and iterated by the Senparc team over many years. It has been tested in numerous systems under .NET Framework 3.5/4.5 and eventually ported to .NET Core (supporting .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0/8.0/9.0), with a high degree of modularity. NCF is currently running stably in many large and medium-sized applications. Thank you for your continuous support, and we welcome your feedback and suggestions, or join the ranks of community contributors!
