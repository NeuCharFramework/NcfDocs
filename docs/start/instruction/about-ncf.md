# About NCF

<img src="./images/logo.png" width="300" />

NeuCharFramework (NCF) is a comprehensive framework for building foundational projects, including basic caching, database, models, validation, and a supporting management backend. It is modular, highly extensible, and durable.

## Philosophy: Simple, Flexible, Extensible

### Simple

Provide a robust and durable underlying framework, not pursuing perfection but practicality.

### Flexible

Stricter DDD model design, combined with modular applications to flexibly respond to changes.

### Extensible

Provide a highly modular architecture, one-click installation, one-second integration.

## Supported .NET Versions

NCF is fully compatible with .NET 8.0.

## Supported Databases

Currently supports SQLite, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Dameng (Dm), and other databases.

## Description

> NCF is derived from the self-use system underlying framework SenparcCore, which has been optimized and iterated by the Senparc team for many years. It has undergone practical tests in numerous systems of .NET Framework 3.5/4.5 and has finally been ported to .NET Core (supporting .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0/8.0). It is highly modular. NCF is currently running stably in many medium and large applications. Thank you for your continuous support. We welcome your suggestions and feedback, or join the ranks of community contributors!
