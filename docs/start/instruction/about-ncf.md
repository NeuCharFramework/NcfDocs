## Philosophy: Simple, Flexible, Extensible

### Simple

Provide a robust and durable underlying framework, not aiming for perfection but practicality.

### Flexible

Stricter DDD mode design, combined with modular applications to flexibly respond to changes.

### Extensible

Provide a highly modular architecture, one-click installation, one-second integration.

## Supported .NET Versions

NCF is fully compatible with .NET 8.0.

## Supported Databases

Currently supports SQLite, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Dameng (Dm), and other databases.

If you need in-depth development or research on basic principles, you can download it.             |
&gt; NCF is derived from the SenparcCore, an underlying framework of the self-use system optimized and iterated by the Senparc team over the years. It has undergone practical tests in many systems of .NET Framework 3.5/4.5 and was finally ported to .NET Core (also supporting .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0/8.0), with a high degree of modularity. NCF is currently running stably in many large and medium-sized applications. Thank you for your continuous support, and we welcome your feedback and suggestions, or join the ranks of community contributors!
&gt; We welcome third-party open-source components to provide their own solutions, which we will test and integrate into NCF.
&lt;!-- In addition to providing you with a complete framework code, we are also working on:
1. [x] Providing a complete project auto-generation service (refer to [WeChatSampleBuilder](http://sdk.weixin.senparc.com/Home/WeChatSampleBuilder)), offering project customization generation services for developers.
1. [x] Providing quick modular development and installation methods.
1. [ ] Open sourcing the WeChat functional modules in [NeuChar.com](https://www.neuchar.com/), which can be integrated using independent modules.
1. [x] Providing complete sample code and documentation.
1. [ ] Providing blogs and video tutorials (developers are also welcome to participate or initiate).
1. [x] Providing a communication community, including but not limited to [Q&A website](https://weixin.senparc.com/QA), [QQ groups](#qq-技术交流群), WeChat groups, and live broadcast groups. --&gt;
