# Frontend and Backend Separation Mode

NeuCharFramework provides developers with two solutions: `Integrated Frontend and Backend (Razor Page)` and `Separated Frontend and Backend (Vue + ElementUI)`. You can choose either method for development and deployment.

&gt; Regardless of which solution you use, the database remains consistent, so both solutions can coexist.&lt;br&gt;
&gt; We recommend using only one solution in a production environment.

## Integrated Frontend and Backend Solution

The integrated solution uses Razor Page. You can use Visual Studio (IISExpress) or the `dotnet` command line.

&gt; For convenience in demonstration and experience, this document will default to introducing the Razor Page method.

### Using Visual Studio

### Using Command Line or Visual Studio Code

Detailed introduction: [Running NCF with CLI](../start-develop/run-ncf-with-cli)

## Separated Frontend and Backend Solution

The separated solution uses the `Vue` + `ElementUI` tech stack.
