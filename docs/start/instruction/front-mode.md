# Frontend-Backend Separation Mode

NeuCharFramework provides developers with two solutions: `Integrated Frontend and Backend (Razor Page)` and `Frontend-Backend Separation (Vue + ElementUI)`. You can choose either method for development and deployment.

&gt; Regardless of which solution you use, the database remains consistent, so both solutions can coexist.&lt;br&gt;
&gt; We recommend using only one solution in a production environment.

## Integrated Frontend and Backend Solution

The integrated frontend and backend solution uses Razor Page. You can use Visual Studio (IISExpress) or the `dotnet` command line.

&gt; For ease of demonstration and experience, this document will default to introducing the Razor Page method.

### Using Command Line or Visual Studio Code

## Frontend-Backend Separation Solution

The frontend-backend separation solution uses the `Vue` + `ElementUI` technology stack.
