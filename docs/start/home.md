> NCF is derived from the SenparcCore, an internal system framework optimized and iterated over many years by the Senparc team. It has been tested in numerous systems on .NET Framework 3.5/4.5 and was eventually ported to .NET Core (supporting .NET 5.0/6.0/7.0/8.0). It is highly modular. NCF is currently running stably in many medium and large applications. Thank you for your continuous support. We welcome your feedback and suggestions, or join the community of contributors!
